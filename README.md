**PROBLEM :**
Stock Price prediction and forecasting is a task that analyses the historical data of stock and predict the future stock prices.
This is valuable for investors to understand the underlying hidden patterns of stock.
This project delivers a user friendly platform to: 
- Predict stock prices from the historical data
- Customize inputs like ticker symbols and dates
- Visualize the actual and predicted prices

**TASK :**
Build a stock price prediction app using:
* Streamlit - interactive interface
* Tensorflow/Keras - LSTM based model
* Yahoo Finance - Data retrieval
* Matplotlob - Visualization

**ACTION :**
1. App Development using streamlit library.
2. Processing of data retrieved from yfinance between the specified time period  .
3. Building model using sequential model of keras and adding LSTM layer at the end.
4. Saving the model built for predicting the future stock prices.
5. Visualizing the actual and predicted data .
6. Predicting price for a future date.

**RESULT :**
* Functiomal Stramlit application for stock price prediction.
* User-friendly with helpful links and interacitve visualizations.
* Accurate Predictions.

**FUTURE ENHANCEMENT :** 
* Supporting multiple tickers.
* Providing gain or loss for the user calculating from the day invested on.
* Predicting the date that will be beneficial to buy stocks and sell them.
* Improving the visualization of data and making it more comprehensive and easy to read.

This project highlights practical use of machine learning, development and visualization to address dinanacial forecasting challenges.
